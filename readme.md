## What We Block

The default uBlock Origin lists block most ads and tracking.

[Web Annoyances Ultralist](https://github.com/yourduskquibbles/webannoyances) blocks most floating items.

This list is for the few ads and annoyances that these two lists don't cover.

Our goal is to block ***everything*** annoying. Anything that disrupts the normal reading flow of the page. Anything that tries to influence the reader to do something unnecessary.

Categories:

- Anything in feeds that is not a normal feed item.
- Banner notifications. Anything from "call volume higher than usual", to COVID, to BLM.
- Minor ads, camoflague ads, and calls to action.
- Free trial nags & banners for same website.

Examples:

- YouTube's homepage has some panels such as "Recommended Movies", "Latest YouTube posts", and "Breaking news". We block those. We just want to see the normal recommended videos.
- New Reddit's homepage has "Updates from Reddit", "Trending today", and "Top broadcast right now" (videos/streamers). We block those. We just want to see the normal recommended posts.
- Your LinkedIn user profile is littered with little nags that try to get you to do things. We block those.
- etc.
